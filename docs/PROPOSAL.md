# Written proposal

- Information is delivered in a slideshow presentation
- There will be interactive tests and activities to be completed during the presentation
- The interactive modules will be:
    1. A quiz about general cybersecurity knowledge
    2. A spot-the-difference game between malicious and legitimate emails

# Technical outline

- `reactjs` will be used for the slideshow, as Liam was already familiar with how it works.
- `SurveyJS` will be used for the quizzes
- We will have to build a custom interface for spot-the-difference
