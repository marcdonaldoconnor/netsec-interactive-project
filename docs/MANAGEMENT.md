# Project management

Liam has self-elected to act as Project Manager. All merge requests targeting `main` are submitted to Liam, who will review the changes and confirm their eligibility before merging.

Everybody has self-assigned themselves to work on specific areas of the project: George is working on the spot-the-email interface, Blake is creating the quizzes and Liam is working on the slideshow.
